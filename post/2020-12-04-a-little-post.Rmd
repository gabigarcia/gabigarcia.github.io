#Here's a cute little post

Just playing around with code

##Reticulate lets R and Python interact

Set Up
```{r setup, include= FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#install.packages('reticulate')
library(reticulate)
```


Python
```{python}
import seaborn as sns

df= sns.load_dataset('diamonds') 
```


R
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(py$df$price,py$df$carat)
```
